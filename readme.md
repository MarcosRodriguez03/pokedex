pokemon api challenge
making a pokedex using an api
Peer reviewer: Jeriah Marson
Peer review: The design great an simple and displays all the information requireed for the assignment
responsiveness works great and I like how the shiny img works as and that you can click on the evolution path and favorites to go to that pokemon. Also the changing background with the type was great too
it does go past gen 5 if you look them up but personally I think thats a plus
